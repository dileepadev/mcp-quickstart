# MCP Quickstart

A fast and flexible starter codebase to quickly explore and understand the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## 🚀 What is MCP?

MCP is a standardized protocol that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and data sources. It allows you to expose functions, data, and prompts in a way that LLMs can understand and utilize.

## ⚙️ What's Inside?

- **Example Tools**: `add(a, b)`, `echo(text)`, `get_time()`
- **Transport Layers**: Stdio (CLI subprocess) and Streamable HTTP (FastAPI)
- **Client Demonstrations**: Invoke tools using Python and `curl`
- **Deployment Guide**: Dockerize and deploy on Azure App Service
